        So my Valentine, I hope you liked this little surprise of mine. I know we cannot meet or do much, but I don't care because this day is not much of a thing for me. I feel like it's Valentine's Day every time I see your sexy ass. All I want to do is grab you, hug you, and kiss you till you can't breathe. The amount of cute aggression I get from you is gonna kill me someday. You watchâ€”you're gonna kill me. That's what you want anyway, bastard. Anyway, I won't blabber on more. I love you. Bye, send me the video of your reaction <33333333.
